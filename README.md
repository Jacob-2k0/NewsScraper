The News Scraper app scrapes articles from the NPR homepage and retrieves the headline, summary and then displays it on the apps home page.
If the user clicks on the title, they will be taken to the article on the NPR website. When the "Scrape New Articles" button is clicked,
the app will scrape any new published articles since previous scrape and delete old articles that are no longer trending.

On each article there is a "Save Article" button which will remove the article from the home page and save it under "Saved Articles". On
the "Saved Articles" page, you can add notes to each article or remove the article from your saves.
